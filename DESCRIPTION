Title: Reversible Jump PDMP Samplers
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Matt Sutton, Augustin Chevalier, Paul Fearnhead, with PolyaGamma simulation code contributed from Jesse Windle and James G. Scott (<https://github.com/jgscott/helloPG>)
Maintainer: Matt Sutton <matt.sutton.stat@gmail.com>
Description: Provides an implementation of the reversible jump piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) methods developed in the paper Reversible Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection (Chevallier, Fearnhead, Sutton 2020, <arXiv:2010.11771>). It also contains an implementation of a Gibbs sampler for variable selection in Logistic regression based on Polya-Gamma augmentation.
